Lasted updated: 8/5/04

Here are the features that you can expect with each release. It may change, so I don't guarantee
that all the features may be implemented according to the release. Some features may not be fully
complete, as marked off by pre-alpha, alpha, and beta.

v0.1.2
------
> diagonal movement
> player names
> main menu

v0.1.5
------
> player customization (age, height, etc.)
> (alpha) items
> larger map (~30x30)

v0.1.8
------
> (beta) items
> (alpha) equipment
> leveling system

v0.1.9
------
> items
> (beta) equipment
> (pre-alpha) NPC's

v0.2.0
------
> equipment
> (alpha) NPC's

This list will be expanded as soon as I figure out what I'll put in next.
