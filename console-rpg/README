Console-RPG 0.1.5
-----------------
(released: 9/20/04)


Background
-----------
Console RPG is a simple text-based RPG game, focused on being a small,
yet interesting game. You can expect everything from a regular RPG: 
monsters, items, equipment, etc. 

Package Info
------------
Initial release 0.1. Don't expect much in this version. The only thing
you can really do is move around.

Install
-------
Type the following in a shell:
1)$ make
2)$ chmod a+x crpg
3)$ ./crpg

Console-RPG should now start.

What's New?
-----------
Some pre-alpha items have been added. You now have an inventory, which you
can look at by typing 'inventory' in-game. Also, you can now save your
current stats to a file (can't be loaded yet) by typing 'save' in-game.

Player customization is in. You will be prompted whether you want to
customize your player before starting a new game. The map is now
30x30 tiles as well.
