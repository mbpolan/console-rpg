Console-RPG 0.2.0a
-----------------
(released: 12/7/04)


Background
-----------
Console RPG is a simple text-based RPG game, focused on being a small,
yet interesting game. You can expect everything from a regular RPG: 
monsters, items, equipment, etc. 

Package Info
------------
Much as been done since the 0.1 release of the package. Many new features
were added with more stability. Also, Console-RPG now runs on Windows 2000/XP
systems, and of course on Linux.

Install
-------
Type the following in a shell:
1)$ make
2)$ chmod a+x crpg
3)$ ./crpg

Console-RPG should now start.

What's New?
-----------
The biggest improvement since the previous release is the ability to run the
package on Windows systems (2000 and higher). Many map bugs were fixed, one being
the item removal bug that disabled items from being removed from the map.

There is also more stability. Most user input code has been reworked so that strange
input doesn't crash the game or throw it into an infinite loop. The long awaited multiplayer
system should now work without any problems, hopefully. Finally, file saving and loading is 
now fully functional.

Note that there are a few unresolved, but not critical, bugs that are in this release. When
you do the save command, a message from the command mkdir will appear informing you that a
directory cannot be made. Ignore that error for now since the directory is indeed made, and
this bug shouldn't disturb gameplay in any way.
