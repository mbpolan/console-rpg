Console-RPG 0.1.8
-----------------
(released: 10/18/04)


Background
-----------
Console RPG is a simple text-based RPG game, focused on being a small,
yet interesting game. You can expect everything from a regular RPG: 
monsters, items, equipment, etc. 

Package Info
------------
Initial release 0.1. Don't expect much in this version. The only thing
you can really do is move around, etc.

Install
-------
Type the following in a shell:
1)$ make
2)$ chmod a+x crpg
3)$ ./crpg

Console-RPG should now start.

What's New?
-----------
Much has been done since the last release. The inventory bug
was fixed, so viewing your inventory is now possible again. A
few more map bugs have been taken care of, so the map system is
near fully functional, with the exception of a few more annoying
bugs that need work. Finally, file loading is working, so you can
continue from where you left off. :)

NOTE about file saving/loading: the savefile is saved to a data/
directory where the CRPG binary is. If that directory doesn't exist,
then please make it! Example:

(Current directory: /home/mike/crpg/)
$ mkdir data

That outta be it. ;)
