===========================
Console RPG Map Editor v0.1
Updated 1/20/05
===========================

-------------
What is this?
-------------

This is a graphical map editor that you can use to make and edit maps for
Console RPG. It can load and save maps directly to and from XML. With this,
you can easily make a custom make and play on it.

-----------------
How does it work?
-----------------

Easily. ;) Pick tiles or objects from the toolbox on the left. Once you
pick a tile, simply click on the map where you want it to be. You can also
change pens to sizes of 2x2, 3x3, and 5x5 to make your work easier. NPC
support is also in, which means you can make an NPC by going to NPC->New NPC.
Enter his name, health, and mana. Click a tile on the map for this NPC to occupy.
Editing NPCs is also simple. Just right click a tile that has the words "NPC" on
it and select "Edit NPC." A dialog will come up where you can change his attributes.

------------------
Requirements/Usage
------------------

This map editor works on Linux/Unix systems that have X installed. I'm not
sure about Windows, but I guess that it may work if anyone can compile it on
Windows. Other than that, it's straightforward.

-----------------------
License and Source Code
-----------------------

The map editor is licensed under the GNU GPL v2. Source code is available at
http://cvs.sf.net/viewcvs.py/console-rpg/crpg-mapedit.

The Qt 3 library is used to do the rendering of graphics and windows.
